1. Transformations

- Allow rotation of the viewpoint around a scene, using what is known as a crystal ball interface.

2. OpenGL scene viewer 

-  Taking an input scene description that specifies the camera, scene width and height, lights (up to 10 lights), 
object geometry (for simplicity, only spheres, teapots and cubes) and material properties. 
The program renders this scene with correct camera positioning and lighting. 
The user should be able to rotate the camera viewpoint.
In addition, they should be able to translate and scale the scene.

3.Ray Tracing
- Writing a first simple raytracer. Raytracers can produce some of the most impressive renderings, with high quality shadows and reflections.
